**Subject: Request to Reactivate Channel and Correct Incorrect Date of Birth**

Dear YouTube Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request the reactivation of my YouTube channel, [Your Channel Name], which was deactivated on [Date of Deactivation]. Additionally, I have noticed an incorrect date of birth listed on my channel/account, and I would like to request that this be updated to reflect the accurate information.

**Channel Details:**
- Channel Name: [Your Channel Name]
- Channel URL: [Your Channel URL]
- Date of Deactivation: [Date of Deactivation]
- Incorrect Date of Birth: [Incorrect Date]
- Correct Date of Birth: [Correct Date]

I believe there may have been a misunderstanding or error that led to the deactivation of my channel. I have always strived to adhere to YouTube's community guidelines and policies, and I am committed to maintaining a positive and compliant presence on the platform.

Could you please review my case and provide guidance on the steps needed to reactivate my channel? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could correct the date discrepancy at your earliest convenience. I am also attaching supporting documents hereby.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]  
[Your Email Address]  
[Your Contact Number]
